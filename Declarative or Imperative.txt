IaC = infrastructure as code

declarative or imperative

Imprative approach:
get shell
get beans
get cheese
get lettuce
get salsa

put beans in shell
put cheese on beans
put lettuce on cheese
put salsa on lettuce


Declarative:
#Make me a taco

food taco "bean-taco" {
   ingredients = [
       "beans", "cheese", "lettuce", "salsa"
   ]


}

Idempotent & consistent

idempotnent - if you haven't change any configuration of your code and you apply it again and again, nothing will change.
Terraform use Idempotnent
Terraform use push (not pull)


baked into the configuration
